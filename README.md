# Simple calculator

This is a simple calculator written for my mobile apps development classes.

It is written for Android phones and tablets in Java. 
It has a basic and advanced mode after you flip your phone into horizontal mode.
I have made layouts for phones and tablets to make it look good.

I am validating the input of the user, so you won't be able to do
some stupid mistakes (e.g. put two dots next to each other). 
But if you somehow make a mistake, the Toast message will pop, so don't worry about anything.
